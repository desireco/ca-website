title: 'Digital Help for Coaches'
layout: '~/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro'

These are things I would like to offer other coaches and I made this page to see if there is interest.
This is not my primary business, more something I discovered and feel like it would be too
good to not share. It does cost money, as it should bring you money.

## Slides and Reels for Instagram

You will get 150 slides and 150 reels for Instagram.
This will be around the topics you coach about, we will discuss the topic and kind of strategies and tips you want to include. These slides and reels will be designed to help you grow your Instagram account and get more clients.
Usually this is plenty of content about single topic.

Price $99

Additional topics: $30

Same offering, 150 of each, but on a different topic. It helps diversify your content.
I would suggest create different background, like vary a color so that people understand you have topic series you are covering on your account.

This is for single order, not if you came later asking for more, just to clarify.


Examples:

Look at #Jake_Tips at my account.

You will need to provide topic and two background images for slides, and different sized background for reels.
1024x1024 for slides, 1080x1920 for reels.
They are formatted as tip or strategy and several ways how you advise people to apply this strategy.

I am working on way to create Stories and single slides, but since I am growing my account this is not a priority for me.
If you would like those, let me know.

Background you can get from me templates in Canva and just update logo and add desired background.

## Email course

Similar to tips, course gives some kind of guidance to your audience, but it can be more detailed.
I like to send them Mon-Fri and Saturday to summarize previous week and offer lighter content.

It starts with welcome and intro, each week Sat has a summary and in the end there is a conclusion and offer for your services. I obviously will just create a conclusion and it is up to you to pitch your services.


- $250 for 2 weeks of email course. Mon-Fri + Saturday (12 emails)
- $350 for 4 weeks of email course. Mon-Fri + Saturday (24 emails)
- $450 for 8 weeks of email course. Mon-Fri + Saturday (48 emails)

Sign up for my email course to see how it looks like:

I have few more in the works. While this is pure email course, you can use it as a base for your signature program.

## Blog posts

If you seriously need help with these, let me know. I wrote all my blog content on the site.

## What you get

For slides and reels, you will get a lot of jpg, sorted by name so you can easily upload and find your way around them.
For email, you will get markdown files for each email, so you can easily copy and paste them to your software.

I use AI to form and create content and some fancy scripts to generate images.

## How to order

Hit me up at Jake Dakich completionistacademy@gmail.com and tell me what you want.
Or Facebook. You really need a clear topic and then I can make it happen.

As for payment, Paypal, but if there are more people, I might add Stripe.

Let's first talk about what you want.
