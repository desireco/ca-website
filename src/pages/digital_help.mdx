These are things I would like to offer other coaches and I made this page to see if there is interest.
This is not my primary business, more something I discovered and feel like it would be too
good to not share. It does cost money, as it should bring you money.

Also, these services are evolving as I am figuring out what works and what doesn't. Check my account for examples:

I can **make for you Instagram slides and reels, email courses and blog posts**.


## Slides and Reels for Instagram

Main offering here is slides and reels for Instagram. 
I will create content for you to post on your Instagram account using AI and 
prompting that I developed. 

Slides are usually tips or strategies, while reels are more like a video version of the same thing.

For example slides look like this:

While Reels are video version of same slides:

You will get plenty of content and you decide what you want to post and when.

#### Price
Year long ie. 365 slides and 365 reels for Instagram is $499.

Half a year is $250 for 150 S&R.

If you want to add additional topic, so your feed looks varied, it is $100 for 100 S&R.

#### You will need to provide

Description of what you do and what kind of topic you want to cover. Focused tips work for Instagram and establish your authority.
Two background images for slides and reels. I will give you Canva template to use. 

### Single topic

I also fould useful to create a series of Reels on single topic with same background.

Example:

$125 for 150 reels.


## Email courses

Similar to tips, course gives some kind of guidance to your audience, but it can be more detailed.

I can make two kinds, one that is meant to be done through the week, with saturday summary.

Usually you have welcome email with intro and then in the end some kind of summary and offer.

Every email covers a topic and often reflect on previous email.

The way to use these is to embed it into your template which would provide context for the reader.

Alternative is to have ongoing email, every day. Those emails are all the same template and don't reflect on each other.


### Pricing

All prices are here:

I have few more in the works. While this is pure email course, you can use it as a base for your signature program.

## Blog posts

If you need help with these, let me know. I wrote all my blog content on the site.

Maybe a package of 50 blog posts for $500.

## What you get

For slides and reels, you will get a lot of jpg and mp4, sorted by name so you can easily upload and find your way around them.
For email, you will get markdown files for each email, so you can easily copy and paste them to your software.

I use AI to form and create content and some fancy scripts to generate images.
