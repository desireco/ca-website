10 Productivity Techniques I Swear By

#### 1. Use Your Calendar as a Personal Roadmap
Instead of relying on a scattered to-do list, I find immense value in scheduling my tasks directly on my calendar. Whenever something new comes up, I simply slot it into an available time slot, just like any other important event. And if something needs to be rescheduled, I can easily drag and drop it to a new time.

For example, each Sunday evening, I take time to plan out my week ahead by filling in my calendar with my most essential to-dos. This ensures nothing falls through the cracks and keeps me focused on my top priorities.

#### 2. The 2-Minute Rule: Just Do It
If a task will take less than two minutes, I make it a point to just complete it right away rather than adding it to my list. As productivity expert David Allen explains, it actually takes longer to capture, track, and remember a minor task than it does to simply knock it out in the moment.

I find this rule particularly helpful for things like responding to a quick email, making a phone call, or jotting down a note. It may seem small, but these tiny tasks can really add up if left to linger.

#### 3. Maintain a "Waiting For" List
Whenever I delegate a task or ask someone else to do something, I immediately add their name to my "waiting for" list. This ensures I never lose track of open threads and can proactively follow up if needed. It's like having an invisible personal assistant keeping tabs on all my outstanding requests.

For instance, if I ask my team member, Sarah, to research a new vendor, I'll add "Sarah - Vendor research" to my waiting list. This way, I can easily reference it and check in with her if I haven't heard back in a reasonable timeframe.

#### 4. Start Each Day with 1-3 Must-Do Items
Before diving into my work, I take a moment to reflect on my top priorities for the day. What are the 1-3 things that, if accomplished, would make today a resounding success? I write these down and make sure to schedule time to tackle them, often first thing in the morning when my mind is freshest.

For example, my 3 must-do items might be:

1) Finish the quarterly report

2) Prep for my 2 pm client meeting

3) Draft the newsletter outline.

Keeping this list short and sweet makes it much more likely I'll actually follow through.

#### 5. Protect Your Deep Work Time Fiercely
If there's one productivity principle I've truly internalized, it's the immense value of uninterrupted, cognitively demanding "deep work." As author Cal Newport argues, this is where the real magic happens - where we can stretch our abilities and produce our finest, most impactful work.

That's why I zealously guard blocks of time dedicated to deep work on my calendar, often in 90-minute increments. During these sessions, I ruthlessly eliminate all distractions - no notifications, no Slack, no internet rabbit holes. Just pure, concentrated focus. I find this approach especially helpful when I need to tackle complex analysis, write long-form content, or work through a thorny problem.

#### 6. Minimize Morning Meetings
I now have a firm rule of no meetings before 3pm. Why? Because I want to reserve those precious morning hours, when my mind is sharpest, for my most important, generative work. Mornings are for "puttering" and deep thinking, as Jeff Bezos famously advocates.

My team has adapted beautifully to this approach. They know that if they want my full attention and best input, the afternoon is the way to go. This simple shift has made a dramatic difference in my productivity and overall sense of control over my time.

#### 7. Leverage "Do Not Disturb" Mode
The power of this simple yet profound tool cannot be overstated. By strategically enabling "do not disturb" modes across my devices, I'm able to effectively create an oasis of calm and focus, shielding my attention from the constant pings, buzzes, and alerts that so often derail our workdays.

In fact, I go even further - when I'm in deep work mode, I'll physically remove my phone from the room, ensuring I'm not tempted to mindlessly check it, even without notifications. This level of environmental control has been a game-changer for my productivity.

#### 8. Keep Work Asynchronous Whenever Possible
One of the biggest drains on my productivity used to be the constant back-and-forth of scheduling and sitting in meetings. But I've learned to be much more selective about when I actually need that real-time interaction. More often than not, I can turn a meeting request into an email conversation, saving precious time and mental energy.

For example, if someone asks to meet, I might respond with: "Happy to help! Could we start this discussion over email? What are the key points you'd like my input on?" This small tweak has made a huge difference in how I allocate my time and attention.

#### 9. Delegate Low-Impact Tasks to a Virtual Assistant
By tapping into the power of virtual assistants (services like Double, Athena, and Fancy Hands), I've been able to offload all sorts of administrative tasks - everything from calendar management to travel booking to basic research. The upfront effort to onboard an assistant is well worth it, as it frees me up to focus on the high-leverage, high-impact work that truly moves the needle.

For instance, I have my VA handle things like scheduling meetings, arranging travel, monitoring my "waiting for" list, and conducting preliminary research on new projects. This allows me to dedicate my time and mental energy to the strategic, creative aspects of my role.

#### 10. Learn to Say No
This may be the single most important productivity lesson I've learned. The reality is, the more we take on, the more scattered and overwhelmed we become. That's why I've made a concerted effort to ruthlessly filter requests and prioritize the vital few over the trivial many.

I find it helpful to ask myself questions like, "Will this further my top priorities?" and "If I had to do this tomorrow, would I be excited about it?" If the answer is no, I politely decline. It's not always easy, but getting comfortable with saying no is essential for maintaining focus and preventing burnout.
