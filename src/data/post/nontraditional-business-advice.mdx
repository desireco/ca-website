### Why Traditional Business Advice Fails and What to Do Instead

#### **Breaking Free from the Herd Mentality**
As a coach, technologist, and entrepreneur, I’ve seen firsthand how traditional business advice can fall flat. There was a time when I thought the key to success was following the “proven” strategies of others—step-by-step plans, rigid schedules, and all the other hallmarks of what we’re told make a business work. But here’s the truth: success doesn’t come from following someone else’s path. It comes from creating your own.

Like many of my coaching clients, I’ve wrestled with the fear of stepping away from the herd. What if my instincts were wrong? What if doing things my way led to failure? That fear of failure is deeply ingrained in all of us. After all, it’s easier to trust the “experts” than it is to trust ourselves.

But here’s what I’ve learned: the best results come when we pause, listen to those inner nudges, and honor the way *our* minds and hearts work. For me—and for many of the people I coach—that often means rejecting traditional business advice and leaning into what feels authentic.

#### **The Problem with Consistency**
In my journey as a coach and entrepreneur, I’ve heard the same refrain over and over: *Be consistent. Show up every day. Post at the same time. Stick to the plan.* It’s good advice on paper. But for people like me, who thrive on creativity and bursts of inspiration, consistency can feel suffocating.

I’ve tried to force myself into the consistency mold. I’ve planned months of content, set rigid schedules, and even tried creating weeks’ worth of Instagram posts in advance. The result? Burnout and frustration. I’ve learned that I’m not wired to work that way—and that’s okay.

Authenticity, not consistency, has been my game-changer. When I show up as myself, whether it’s a blog post, coaching session, or Instagram reel, the connection is stronger. People aren’t looking for perfect schedules; they’re looking for real, relatable humans.

#### **Embracing Messy Action**
One of the hardest lessons I’ve had to learn is that perfection isn’t the goal. As a natural problem solver, I want everything I create—whether it’s a program, a piece of content, or a new project—to match the vision in my head. But perfectionism is a trap.

I remind my coaching clients (and myself) of this truth often: *done is better than perfect*. Messy action is still action. The draft that’s “good enough” still moves the needle forward. And sometimes, it’s the imperfect, raw, and authentic efforts that resonate most deeply with others.

One of my favorite examples is my coaching sessions. I used to think I needed the perfect script or outline to deliver value. Now, I trust myself to show up, listen deeply, and respond authentically in the moment. Those “messy” sessions? They’re often the most impactful.

#### **Avoid Building a Business You Hate**
I know what it feels like to be trapped in a career that doesn’t align with who you are. Before becoming a coach, I spent years in business development and tech, following the traditional paths of success. But even when I was “successful” on paper, I felt stuck. It wasn’t until I allowed myself to explore what I truly wanted—freedom, purpose, and connection—that I began to build a business I love.

Many entrepreneurs make the mistake of building a business they hate. They follow the rules, meet the metrics, and hit their goals, only to find that they’ve created a life that feels like a prison. That’s not the dream. The dream is to create a business—and a life—that aligns with your values and allows you to thrive.

For me, that means structuring my coaching practice around flexibility and creativity. It means showing up authentically, even when it’s messy. It means working with people I love and avoiding environments that drain me. That’s the kind of business I help my clients build, too.

#### **Building Systems That Work for You**
Not all systems are created equal, and what works for one person won’t necessarily work for another. I’ve learned that the hard way. Early in my entrepreneurial journey, I tried to follow the blueprints of successful businesspeople I admired. But their systems—meticulously planned calendars, hyper-detailed business plans, and rigid workflows—just didn’t work for me.

So, I started experimenting. I audio-record my ideas on walks. I use sticky notes instead of spreadsheets. I design processes that feel natural and energizing instead of overwhelming. And it’s made all the difference.

This is what I teach my clients: success isn’t about copying someone else’s system. It’s about finding what works for you and making it your own.

#### **Authenticity Over Consistency**
If there’s one lesson I want every entrepreneur to learn, it’s this: *authenticity beats consistency every time*. Showing up as your authentic self will build trust, connection, and loyalty in ways that rigid consistency never can.

When I post a blog or share on Instagram, it’s not because my schedule says I have to. It’s because I have something meaningful to share. And my audience feels that. They don’t care if I’ve posted at 9 a.m. sharp every day this week. They care that what I’m saying is real.

If you’re struggling to balance authenticity and consistency, my advice is simple: choose authenticity. Be real. Be relatable. Show up when it matters, and let go of the pressure to be perfect.

#### **A Challenge for You**
If you’re feeling stuck in your business or life, I want to challenge you to think differently. Ask yourself: *Is there a way to approach this that aligns with my strengths?* Maybe it’s letting go of perfectionism, embracing messy action, or creating a system that feels natural instead of forced. Whatever it is, trust yourself to find a way that works for you.

As a coach, I’ve seen the transformation that happens when people stop trying to follow someone else’s rules and start creating their own. It’s not just about business—it’s about building a life that feels authentic, fulfilling, and aligned with who you are.

If this resonates with you, I’d love to help you explore your unique path. Whether it’s through my coaching programs or just the insights shared here, my goal is to empower you to trust yourself, embrace your authenticity, and build something truly extraordinary.

So, here’s to messy action, weird ideas, and doing things your way. Let’s create something amazing together.
