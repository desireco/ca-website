## Why People Don’t Follow Advice (and How You Can Start Taking Action)

Did you know most people don't follow advice even if they ask for it?

Hey, it’s Jake here. I’ve seen it countless times—both in my own life and with the people I coach. We hear good advice, we nod along, and then we… do nothing. Trust me, I’ve been there. I’ve ignored advice that I knew would help me, and I’ve watched others do the same. In fact, a study found that 92% of advice goes ignored. The real question is: *why*?

It’s not about a lack of intelligence, and it’s not that the advice is bad. There are deeper psychological, emotional, and even logistical reasons that keep people from acting. Let’s break down the common reasons why people don’t follow through on advice—and more importantly, how you can start changing that today.

### 1. **Advice Overload: Too Much Input, Not Enough Focus**
We live in a time where advice is everywhere. Every time you scroll your feed, there’s someone telling you how to live a better life, grow your business, or be more productive. I’ve been there, overwhelmed by the sheer amount of advice and ideas floating around. With so much information, it’s hard to know where to start.

#### My Advice:
- **Filter Your Sources:** Stick to a few trusted mentors, books, or experts that truly resonate with you. You don’t need to follow everyone’s advice, just the ones that align with your goals.
- **Prioritize Actionable Steps:** Ask yourself, *is this advice relevant to me right now?* If not, it’s okay to shelve it for later. Focus on advice that fits your current stage of life or business.

### 2. **Fear of Failure: What If It Doesn’t Work?**
I’ll admit it—there were times when I didn’t follow good advice because deep down, I was afraid of what might happen if it didn’t work. That fear of failure can paralyze you. What if you put yourself out there and fall flat? It’s easier to stay in your comfort zone, right?

#### My Advice:
- **Embrace Failure as Learning:** I’ve learned that failure is just part of the process. It doesn’t mean you’re not capable—it just means you’re learning. Take action knowing that even if you stumble, you’ll gain valuable insights for next time.
- **Take Small, Manageable Steps:** Start with small, low-risk actions that ease you into the advice. Build your confidence by getting a few small wins under your belt.

### 3. **Lack of Emotional Buy-In: You Don’t Feel Connected**
I’ve noticed that people don’t follow advice when it doesn’t hit them emotionally. It’s not enough for advice to make sense logically; it has to resonate with how you *feel*. If you don’t feel a connection to the advice, it’s easy to ignore it.

#### My Advice:
- **Find Your “Why”:** Ask yourself, *Why is this advice important to me?* How does it connect with your deeper values or personal goals? When advice aligns with your core motivations, it’s much easier to act on.
- **Personalize the Advice:** Tailor the advice to your specific situation. If the advice feels too abstract or general, tweak it so that it feels more applicable to your life.

### 4. **Comfort Zones: Change Feels Uncomfortable**
I know firsthand how hard it is to step outside your comfort zone. Sometimes, even when you know the advice will help, it’s easier to stick with what’s familiar. Change feels uncomfortable, and the brain naturally resists it.

#### My Advice:
- **Lean Into Discomfort:** Growth happens outside the comfort zone. Whenever I feel resistance, I remind myself that discomfort is a sign of progress. Embrace it.
- **Build Routines Around Change:** Start small. Incorporate new habits gradually, making them a part of your routine. Over time, the new actions will feel less uncomfortable as they become part of your daily life.

### 5. **Lack of Immediate Results: You Don’t See Instant Payoff**
I’ve fallen into this trap plenty of times—following advice but feeling discouraged because I didn’t see instant results. In a world where we expect quick wins, advice that requires time and patience can feel like it’s not working.

#### My Advice:
- **Focus on the Long Game:** Some of the best advice I’ve ever followed took time to show results. Don’t give up just because you don’t see progress right away. Trust the process.
- **Celebrate Small Wins:** I’ve learned to appreciate the small victories along the way. Even if the big result isn’t there yet, celebrate the little things that show you’re moving in the right direction.

### 6. **Self-Sabotage: Deep-Rooted Limiting Beliefs**
This one’s tough. Sometimes, I’ve found myself (and others) not following advice because of deep-seated beliefs about what we deserve. Whether it’s imposter syndrome, fear of success, or old limiting beliefs, self-sabotage can creep in and keep you from taking action.

#### My Advice:
- **Identify Your Limiting Beliefs:** Pay attention to the self-talk that happens when you consider following through on advice. Are you telling yourself things like “I’m not good enough” or “This won’t work for me”? Identify these thoughts and challenge them.
- **Get Support:** I’ve found that working with a coach or even just talking with a trusted friend can help shine a light on limiting beliefs and provide you with a fresh perspective.

### 7. **Misaligned Timing: Right Advice, Wrong Time**
Ever receive great advice that you *know* is good, but it just doesn’t feel relevant to you at the time? I’ve had moments where solid advice didn’t stick because it wasn’t the right moment in my life or business to act on it.

#### My Advice:
- **Save Advice for Later:** Not every piece of advice needs to be acted on immediately. If it doesn’t fit where you are right now, make a note of it and revisit it later when the timing aligns.
- **Focus on What’s Relevant Now:** Be honest with yourself about where you are on your journey. Sometimes, advice can be too far ahead of your current situation. Focus on advice that meets you where you are.

---

### 8. **Accountability: No Follow-Up System in Place**
One of the reasons I’ve seen advice get ignored is because there’s no system in place to hold yourself accountable. Without accountability, it’s easy to slip back into old habits and routines.

#### My Advice:
- **Build Accountability Systems:** Whether it’s through a coach, an accountability group, or a friend, having someone check in with you is a game-changer. I’ve seen this firsthand with my own clients—accountability drives action.
- **Track Your Progress:** I use tools like habit trackers or journals to monitor my own progress. Reflecting on what’s working (or not) helps keep me moving forward, even when motivation dips.

## Conclusion: **How to Start Following Advice**

I know it’s easy to get stuck in a cycle of receiving advice and not acting on it. But if you can identify what’s holding you back, you can start to make real changes. Filter the noise, lean into discomfort, and set up systems that make it easier to follow through.

The advice you receive is only useful if you take action on it. So, ask yourself: *What’s one piece of advice I’ve been ignoring?* Identify the reason why and take the first small step today. You’ve got this.
