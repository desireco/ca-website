# 11 Tips For Your Next Digital Detox

Hey, it's Jake here, and if you're feeling like screens are taking over your life, you're not alone. Between checking your phone first thing in the morning, and being glued to screens throughout the day, it's easy to get overwhelmed by the digital world. But here’s the thing: a digital detox can help you reclaim some of the real-life magic that gadgets tend to steal. Even if you're not dealing with headaches or eyestrain, taking a break can refresh your mind, body, and soul. So, if you're up for it, let's dive into 11 ways to get started!

### 1. Get Help If You Need It
If you or someone close to you thinks you're a bit too attached to your devices, don't stress — there's help! Nowadays, there are all kinds of resources, from digital detox camps to apps designed to help you unplug. You can even find support programs similar to those for substance abuse. Remember, it's okay to ask for help to reset your digital habits.

### 2. Re-learn How to Entertain Yourself (Without a Screen!)
Remember the days before smartphones? Let's tap into that! Try meditating, spacing out, or just enjoying your surroundings. It might feel weird at first, but giving your brain a break without screens can help you feel more present and grounded.

### 3. Create a “Digital Sundown” Routine
Here’s a must-do: set a nightly screen cut-off time. Research shows that late-night screen time can mess with your sleep. So, put those devices away at least an hour before bed and let your body unwind. Trust me, you’ll feel more rested and recharged.

### 4. Go Old School With Pen and Paper
Need a break from typing or tapping? Grab a notebook! Whether it’s doodling or jotting down ideas, using pen and paper is a refreshing change for your brain. Plus, it’s a nice way to give your fingers a break from the constant swiping.

### 5. Dial Down the Social Media
Social media is fun, but it can be a time sink. To regain control, set specific times to check in. Morning and evening can be enough. After that, log out and get back to real life.

### 6. Manage Your Emails Like a Pro
Feeling overwhelmed by email notifications? You’re not alone. Try turning off those pings and setting specific times to check your inbox. You’ll be amazed at how much clearer your head feels.

### 7. Rediscover the Joy of Reading (With a Real Book!)
Instead of reading on your phone or tablet at night, try a good old-fashioned book. Use amber lights or blue-light blocking glasses if you must read on a screen, but a paper book can be a peaceful way to wind down.

### 8. Hide Your Phone at Night
Still need your phone nearby for emergencies? No problem! Just keep it face down or tucked away so that random notifications don’t disturb your sleep.

### 9. Get a "Dumb" Watch
If you're constantly checking your phone just to see the time, it might be time to switch to a basic watch. This small change can help cut down on unnecessary phone usage.

### 10. Spend Time in Phone-Free Zones
Find places where phones aren’t welcome — yoga classes, meditation groups, or even a swim at the pool. These are great opportunities to be fully present without a phone buzzing in your pocket.

### 11. Schedule Your Digital Detox
Finally, make it official! Put your digital detox on the calendar, just like any other appointment. Try a nightly “digital sunset” or even a full day each week to unplug. From there, you can build up to a full weekend or more. You’ll be surprised how refreshing it can be!
