## Overview

_Breakthrough Sprint_ ie. _Breakthrough Mini_ (working title for that program) is a short 2 week program.

We don't talk about feelings, values or beliefs there. You pick goal and we help you break it down in milestones and pick something that will get you started.
Then it is all you, working and we are supporting you and checking up on you. It is a very practical and tactical program.

So people were asking me, would it be good for this or for that. Often a book. Yes, it would be.
That inspired me to do a brainstorming session and here are some ideas for a breakthrough sprint.

Main idea is that we will support and help you plan and get started in whatever you need to get done. This is often main reason why people postpone doing things.
